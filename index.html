          <p><span class = "sideBarTitle">Character Recognition</span>The formal principle of OCR-B was based on the premise that each character must differ from another by at least 7 per cent in the worst possible case. To check this, two characters were superimposed in such a way that they covered each other optimally
            <span class = "figHeading">/08/</span>. Additionally, this test was carried out using two different printing weights: a fine weight caused by weak pressure on the keys of the typewriter keyboard or through a lack of ink on the typewriter ribbon, as well as a fat, squashed weight caused by strong pressure on the keys or by bleeding ink. Even if the fine and fat weights ere superimposed-the difference of 7 per cent still had to be guaranteed
            <span class = "figHeading">/12/</span>. A test print demonstrates the principle
            <span class = "figHeading">/10/</span>. It shows a vastly fattened N and a thin M, which the computer had to clearly identify as such based on the difference (shown in red). Generous character spacing was needed to guarantee correct processing
            <span class = "figHeading">/31/</span>; serifs, on the other hand, were rather detrimental to performance since they increased the coverage ration of the characters
            <span class = "figHeading">/09/</span>. Furthermore, the paper should not be reflective and the type should not bear any stains.

          <p>There followed a period of rapid technological progress: by 1970 standard type writer faces were machine-readabe, as are books, newsprint and handwriting today.</p>

            While the width of each single character was the same for all manufacturers, the height would partly differ /18/. Following the demands of the bigger companies, we would eventually have three heights /19/, since it was cheaper to adapt the typeface than to change the production of the machines. It made no difference to us, we just had to do the work three times over. For one year we were practically fully occupied with the development of these matrices. Andre Giirtler was part of the team at the time and in 1964 Nicole Delamarre joined us as well. Of utmost importance was the difference between capitals and numerals. For a long time we experimented with identical heights but there would always be pairs that didn't work. The B-8 combination caused us some major headache: specifically, the machines that read the counter would never recognize the difference correctly. Eventually I came up with the idea to keep the numerals higher than the capitals â€” that was the solution /23/. Since the numerals were of correct proportions right from the start and thus formed the basis for the standard, all the capitals of the typeface were eventually scaled down.

            For the typewriters all characters had to be of even width, these were monospaced faces. Therefore we had to draw a narrow m /25/. I staunchly refused to introduce any serifs if it wasn't absolutely necessary. But with i j and I we had no choice, because of the danger of them being confused /15/; the 1 got a curve at the bottom. That the D eventually turned out to be a bad shape might have been due to technical issues. In the first version it is very beautiful /24/, in the final one it seems to be narrower /26/. The C too turned out far too narrow in the end. With the K, the arm and tail don't come to an acute point on the stem. I've never done that anywhere else but there was no other option technically. If there had been a gap in the centerline, the reader would possibly have read the K as a stroke and a chevron.
